#### ELECTRCICAL FAULT CLASSIFICATION AND DETECTION

### Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for  classifying and detecting various types of electrical faults in transmission lines. The project uses advanced algorithms and data analysis to enhance the efficiency of power distribution and reduce the risks associated with electrical faults, such as power outages and wildfires. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training to accurately classify and detect faults. The project uses various machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics to ensure the model's performance and reliability. The project's goal is to improve the overall performance and reliability of the power distribution system by accurately detecting and classifying electrical faults.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement addressed, involves classifying and detecting faults in a system based on the  dataset. The dataset contains features like 'fault_indicator', 'feature1', 'feature2_Y', and 'feature2_Z', which are used to predict and classify faults in the system. The goal is to preprocess the data, analyze its distribution, train machine learning models, and evaluate their performance to accurately classify faults in the system.

### Key Objectives

The file contains code for data preprocessing, including loading the dataset, imputing missing values using the mean strategy, and applying label encoding and one-hot encoding to categorical columns. The dataset consists of features like 'fault_indicator', 'feature1', 'feature2_Y', and 'feature2_Z'. The code snippet displays the first few rows of the dataset after preprocessing, showcasing the transformed data with encoded categorical columns.

### Data Source

The dataset sourced from kaggle kernels output ani1656/fault-detection-classification -p /path/to/dest .

### Data Descripton

Includes features like 'G', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'Ia', 'Ib', 'Ic', 'Va', 'Vb', and 'Vc'. These features represent different aspects of the system being analyzed. The dataset consists of multiple rows, each containing values for these features. The features may have numerical or categorical values, and they play a crucial role in the analysis and classification of faults in the system.

This dataset is used for a machine learning project that involves classifying and detecting faults in a system. The dataset consists of four features and one target variable.

### Data Visualization

The following figure shows a boxplot of the features by fault_indicator:

From the figure, we can see that there is a clear difference in the distribution of the features between the faulty and non-faulty cases. For example, feature1 has a higher mean value in the faulty cases compared to the non-faulty cases. Similarly, feature2_Y and feature2_Z have a higher proportion of faulty cases in the 1 value compared to the 0 value.

### Data Preparation

The dataset has been preprocessed by melting the data into long format, where each row represents a single observation with a feature name and its corresponding value. This allows for easier visualization and analysis of the data.

The following code snippet shows how the data was melted:

### Reshape the data into long format

data_melted = pd.melt(data, id_vars=['fault_indicator'], value_vars=['feature1', 'feature2_Y', 'feature2_Z'],
                      var_name='Feature', value_name='Value')


### Conclusion

This dataset is useful for classifying and detecting faults in a system based on the values of four features. The data visualization shows that there is a clear difference in the distribution of the features between the faulty and non-faulty cases. The data has been preprocessed into long format, making it easy to analyze and visualize.

### Recommendations

1. Feature Importance: Conduct further analysis to determine the most important features that contribute significantly to fault detection. This can help in focusing on key variables for model training.

2. Model Selection: Explore different machine learning algorithms beyond the ones used in the notebook, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), to identify the most suitable model for fault classification.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model to improve its performance and generalization capabilities.

4. Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation techniques to ensure the model's robustness and reliability by testing its performance on multiple subsets of the data.

5. Ensemble Methods: Consider ensemble methods like Random Forest or XGBoost to combine multiple models for enhanced accuracy and stability.

6. Threshold Adjustment: Adjust the classification threshold based on the business requirements to balance between false positives and false negatives.

7. Monitoring System: Implement a monitoring system that continuously evaluates the model's performance in real-time to ensure its effectiveness in detecting faults.
